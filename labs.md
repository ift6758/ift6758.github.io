- Data Science Class: Lab Introduction, September 3, [slides](lab_materials/Data%20science%20class%20lab%20intro.pdf)

2. Week 2 (September 9 -- September 15):
- Introduction to Python, September 10, [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ghrTY960LyDJ2WokoxqrSnL7Ojbq2FOW), [solution](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pX9xhyLIUE1OJtfXUvlN8RALkJfsWGVE), [notebook download](lab_materials/lab1_python/intro.ipynb), [solution download](lab_materials/lab1_python/intro_solution.ipynb)

  - IDE's (Interactive development environments):
    1. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
       Community edition is free and free licences for students available
    2. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
       This is an editor, not an IDE, but it has many features for programmers
    3. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
       Same as Sublime, this is an editor
    3. Emacs and Vim with plugins
       These editors have quite steep learning curve
    4. [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
3. Week 3 (September 16 -- September 22)
- Introduction to NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib  [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1loNALZph2WrseXNo8JMhLWZmHlETTiKK)
4. Week 4 (September 23 -- September 29)
- Computing resources and setup for the project.

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
[Putty](https://www.putty.org/)

The simplest way to make use of a library on the server is to first load the corresponding module, e.g., 

```
module load miniconda/3 

```
